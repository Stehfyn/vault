```
For monadic reasons I agree. However, I would not consider your example as a good reason, because returning std::optional<Foo&> breaks some encapsulation of maybeGetFoo().

Secondly, I understand people want brevity, but std::reference_wrapper is available since C++11. Why cry for std::optional<T&>? There is always template <typename T> using optional_ref = std::optional<std::reference_wrapper<T>> (https://godbolt.org/z/93cGaP1GW) without making library and language more complex.
